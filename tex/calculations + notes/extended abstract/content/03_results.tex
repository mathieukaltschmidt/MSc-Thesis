\section{Preliminary Results}
Up to now, we finished the computation of the quark self energy diagram and compared those results in the chiral limit $\lambda_i\rightarrow 0$ to perturbative results, performed the spectral regularization via the BPHZ-scheme, set up the iteration and performed a few trials. Currently the iteration is updated and finalized to be finally able to extract the spectral functions.
